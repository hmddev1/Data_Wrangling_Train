Hmddev/August 2022/ version 0.0.1

Sometimes there are a lots of missing data in data frame. So we have to dealing with them. 
You can train some methods to resolve:
                                1. Droping: This way might cause to remove some columns or rows. This is not always a good way. 
                                2. Replacing: This is the logical way.
